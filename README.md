Hi,
Assignment code is Ready, Divided By Folders per Each Assingment:
# Part 1
- include js code file with node server to run console and see the results.
- also include html file to run in the browser
# Part 2
- I have created a react App using vite, check readme file in app to see how to run.
- I took the liberty to design a little bit the app and also add some features just for showing best practices.

Thanks!
